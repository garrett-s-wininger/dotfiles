# Helix

Helix is an alternative text-editor that operates similarly to a
batteries-included Neovim config. In order to apply the settings to a local
environment, the `config.toml` file must be symlinked to
`~/.config/helix/config.toml`. This can be done while the editor is running,
so long as you then run `:config-reload` to apply changes to your current
session.
