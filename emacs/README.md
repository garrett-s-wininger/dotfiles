# Emacs

This directory contains my primary Emacs configuration for developing in a
number of languages. To apply this to your local machine, you can simply
link it via `ln -s "${CHECKOUT_DIR}/emacs/init.el" ~/.emacs.d/init.el`.
At that point, you can either load the file via `M-X load-file` or close
and reopen Emacs for the changes to take effect.
