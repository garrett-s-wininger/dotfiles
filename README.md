# Editor Configs

This repository contains a number of editor configs that I typically use to
speed up my development process. Generally, this fits into the category of
text editors like `vim` or `neovim` but may also include other helpful configs
for things like `tmux` which are essential to my workflow. Each subdirectory
for a configured application will contain a README in order to understand how
to apply the settings as well as why the settings were chosen.
