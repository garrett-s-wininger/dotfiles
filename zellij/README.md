# Zellij Configuration

Zellij is an alternative option for managing multiple panes, tabs, and sessions
ala TMux/Screen/Wezterm. This section of the repo contains the main settings
that I use on a daily basis. In order to use the settings, you'll want to add
a symlink from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zellij over to this folder in your checkout.
Once complete, the next invocation of `zellij` should pick up the new changes.
